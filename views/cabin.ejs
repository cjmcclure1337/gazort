    <h1>The Cabin</h1>
    <p>You peer through the open doorway, but no one seem to be home. As you enter the cabin it smells of smoke and strange spices. Every space in the cabin is filled with some kind of trinket - boxes of strange sticks and baubles cover the floor, and jars of various liquids and herbs cover the shelves.</p>
